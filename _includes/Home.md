## What is Open Scholarship?

 Open Scholarship is an umbrella term for an approach that aims to make  research and education accessible, reproducible, and freely available to people within and outside of academics.  

Open Scholarship includes Open Publishing and Fair Data but is a broad concept  that still needs more "unboxing".
