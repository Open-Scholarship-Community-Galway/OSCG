### What is Open Scholarship?

 Open Scholarship is an umbrella term for an approach that aims to make  research and education accessible, reproducible, and freely available to people within and outside of academics.  

Open Scholarship is a young concept that still needs more "unboxing". 

We have adapted the concept of the "Eight Pillars" of Open Scholarship defined by the [EU](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-policy-platform):
