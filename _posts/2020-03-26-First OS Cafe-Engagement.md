### Engaging with the public!!
We recently did a little poll among OSCG members to see where she would start with our Open agenda. And the clear number one spot was *Engaging with the public*. What we mean by that is the influence research has beyond academia, the (two-way) communication with the general, and in some cases the active participation of members of the general public in the research process (such as data gathering and analysis).

### Learning from each other
So in our Café on 26 March we want to hear some examples of engagement, exchange experience and see what has worked (and what has not).
We are glad to have members from [Pint of Science Ireland](https://pintofscience.ie/) telling us about their organisation and how they achieve engagement with the public in an enjoyable environment.

### Do you have an engagement story to tell
We are still looking for short contributions of case studies and thoughts on engagement or citizen science. Please get in touch with Hardy (hardy.schwamm@nuigalway.ie) if you want to present.

### Open Scholarship Cafes are open to everyone - Pizza included!
Our Open Scholarship Community Galway is open to new members. But you don't have to be a member if you are curious and want to spend an hour with Open enthusiasts. Please let us know that you are coming so we can plan numbers. We will be meeting in **NUIG Arts Millennium Building, Room AS 207 (CELT Training Room) from 12-1pm**.
If you arrive a bit early you can get some tasty vegetarian pizza - sponsored by the [James Hardiman Library](https://library.nuigalway.ie/digitalscholarship/openscholarship/)!
Our Cafes are informal and friendly events, everyone welcome!
