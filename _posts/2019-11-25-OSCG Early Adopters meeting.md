# Early Adopters Meeting
[**Register here if you want to join the Open Science Community Galway**](http://bit.ly/OSCGalwayInterest)
## What will happen at this meeting?
This will be the very first meeting of Open enthusiasts in Galway. It will be nice to connect enthusiasts from across NUI Galway campus and beyond. We will do that in an informal and friendly manner over (free) **pizza**. 

Among first things we might like to talk about are:

- Where are we on the [step-by-step guide from OSC Utrecht](https://docs.google.com/document/d/112B-OCArTI-zdDZ6S67BPVHSn6gPL9GgmluoQ35zG40/edit)?
- How should OSCG members communicate? (Website, Twitter, Teams/WhatsApp etc.)
- What are our next steps (events, recruiting more members etc.)?
