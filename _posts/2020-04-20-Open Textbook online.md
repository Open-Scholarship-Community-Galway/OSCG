# Open Scholarship Café extra: Open Education for Accessibility and Affordability. 20 April, 1-2pm, online
This is our first co-hosted event and we are very happy to collaborate with the [NUI Galway Students' Union](https://su.nuigalway.ie/), [College of Science & Engineering](https://www.nuigalway.ie/science/), and the [NUI Galway Library](http://www.library.nuigalway.ie/) The title of the event is "Open Education for Accessibility and Affordability".

Please register here if you want to come along: https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/open-education-for-accessibility-and-affordability-tickets-96858166383

### Why is this event important?
Concerns over issues of affordability and accessibility relating to the traditional textbook model have helped spur the development of a substantial ecosystem of [OER](https://www.oercommons.org/) (Open Educational Resource), including [Open Textbooks](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks). 

OER are published such that they are **freely available, free to use and reuse,** and often free to change and adjust to local needs and circumstances, thus presenting a more accessible way to engage with learning resources for a student population with diverse backgrounds, abilities, skill sets, and needs.

### What to expect from the session?
This event will feature three short talks. 

The first will be by the Student Union's [Cameron Keighron](https://su.nuigalway.ie/team-member/education-officer/) (Education Officer) and [Scott Green](https://su.nuigalway.ie/team-member/su-council-chairperson/) (Council Chairperson), who will outline the student experience of accessing textbooks and other learning resources via traditional publishing channels and the potential of Open Textbooks as an alternative. 

The second speaker will be [Niall Madden](http://www.maths.nuigalway.ie/~niall/), School of Maths, and his experience using Open Textbooks from [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/). The third speaker will be [Kris Meen](https://libguides.library.nuigalway.ie/prf.php?account_id=95571), who will talk about using OER in the context of the Library's Academic Skills service and how the Library can help people get started on their OER journey.

### Quick guide to OER
The NUI Galway Library has just developed an [OER LibGuide](https://libguides.library.nuigalway.ie/OER) that should give everyone who is new to the topic a quick introduction (Thanks Kris!).
