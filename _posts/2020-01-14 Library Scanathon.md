# Scanathon. Crowd-sourced digitisation

[**Register here**](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/scanathon-crowd-sourced-digitisation-tickets-79687406177)

## Description
Using the [NUIG Library](http://www.library.nuigalway.ie/)'s recently acquired ScanTent, (developed as part of the READ  project, for more information, see https://scantent.eu/en/ ), and our  trustee SLR cameras, this event will see participants divided into  teams. The event will be a race to see which piece of equipment copes  better with rapid digitisation, with lighting, clarity, processing  speed, and image quality for the web weighted as the measures of  success. 

There will also be spot prizes for rapid fire rounds of  digitisation, finding a gremlin in the collection of archives you are  working on, and more besides!

In the workshop, we will work  together to digitise and publish a collection of archives for the web.  The output will be a crowd-sourced piece of work that opens up a  collection of archives to the wider world for research and consultation.
