# First OSCG Meeting 25 November 2019
*Here is a brief summary of the First OSCG Meeting - ever!*

### Welcome everyone!
17 people attended our First Meeting. A very good turnout! I haven't quite figured out how to embed images on a blog post but you can see some pictures at our [OSCGalway](https://twitter.com/OSCGalway) Twitter profile. Special thanks to [Fiona Concannon](http://www.nuigalway.ie/centre-excellence-learning-teaching/staff/staffprofiles/fionaconcannon/) from CELT who helped with the room! Anyone who wants to look at the introductory slides that I used they are [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DADq4c4aKlw/QNncvjPaIMPN0zAnDnLgeg/view?utm_content=DADq4c4aKlw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu).  

### Thinking about OSCG Principles
At some point in the near future we might need to formalise this but it seems  that key principles of our Community are: 

- open to everyone in Galway 
- inclusive (with regards to disciplines, aspects of open Scholarship, seniority etc.)
- researcher-led.   

### **What does Open Scholarship mean?**  
This is an important and ongoing discussion. Our concept of Open Scholarship is based on the [Open Science Policy Framework](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-policy-platform) of the EU Commission but we need to adapt it to the needs of our Community. There were some interesting comments on scope and wording of the Eight Pillars.

You can see the latest version of the [Eight Pillars here](https://www.canva.com/design/DADkU4Hc67E/QJtWSeC-KPFt6o99cg7N8A/view?utm_content=DADkU4Hc67E&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).

### What is next for OSCG?
This is early days but we are thinking about the following:

- Open Scholarship Community Galway members meetings. The next one will be in the second half of January. Interested in coming along? Sign up here: http://bit.ly/OSCGalwayInterest
- **Open Scholarship Café**. A semi-formal meeting 4-6 times per year with topics sourced from the Community, such as data sharing, open source software, data visualisation, Text & Data Mining, journal clubs, open textbooks, open publishing…   
- **Open Scholarship Week 2020**. A series of events in early May. More details to follow soon
