### Why Open Scholarship?

Open Scholarship is a global movement towards research and educational practices that are collaborative and transparent. The aim of Open Scholarship is to make research and educational resources such as publications, data, research outputs and teaching and learning resources publicly available as early as possible, as well as actively encouraging participation in the research process by the general public and co-creation of knowledge.

 The current coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the value of open access to scientific research and teaching more than ever. Open Scholarship Week 2020 will look at successful national and international examples of grassroots Open Scholarship enthusiasm and explore how we can use such examples in our local context. We will explore how Open practices translate to different disciplines and how Openness can be used in teaching.  What should the role of universities be in a society that is increasingly networked and open?

 Open Scholarship Week 2020 builds on the successful Open Science Week 2019, which was the first of its kind in Ireland. OSW 2020 will again bring together researchers, academics, educators, and members of the public to highlight and showcase what open scholarship is and how to work together towards creating knowledge that is open and accessible to everyone. Online events taking place across this week will target several elements of Open Scholarship, including Open Data, Open Access, Open Education and Citizen Science.

### Get involved!

All sessions will involve Q&As, the workshops will be interactive. Please follow **#oswgalway2020** on Twitter and join the discussions.
