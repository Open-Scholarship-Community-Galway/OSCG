# OpenStreetMap workshop
[**Register here**](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/openstreetmap-workshop-tickets-78039926521)
## Description
The Insight Centre for Data Analytics at NUI Galway is hosting a workshop Saturday November 23rd for community groups, environmentalists, science researchers, geographers, planners and students to learn about and participate in OpenStreetMapping, a free, editable map of the whole world that is being built by volunteers. The underlying electronic data is open-sourced and crowd-sourced.

Organised by Ireland’s OpenStreetMap (OSM) community, the free event is open to all interested individuals and groups and will commence from 11am at the Insight Centre of the Data Science Institute in the Dangan Business Park.

This information and workshop event, taking place as part of our centre’s Citizen Science schedule, will provide a wonderful opportunity for both experts and novices to exchange ideas and experiences on this very important grassroots global initiative.
