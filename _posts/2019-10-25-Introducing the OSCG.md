# Do we need a Community of Open Scholars at Galway?
*NUI Galway's new Open Scholarship Librarian Hardy Schwamm with a few thoughts on an Open Community.*
### Appetite for Openness?
"Many researchers are interested to adopt Open Science practices in the way they do research."
This the first statement of the [OSC Utrecht About page](https://openscience-utrecht.com/about-us/). I think this is true!
In my previous role at Lancaster University we did a survey and [86 per cent](https://www.slideshare.net/LancUnivLibrary/promoting-a-culture-of-open-research-at-lancaster-university/20?src=clipshare) of Lancaster researchers agreed that Open Research should be an institutional priority. I believe the same survey at NUI Galway would produce similar results.

### Connecting Open Enthusiasts
In my first few weeks at NUI Galway (I arrived here in mid-August) I have spoken to quite a few researchers who support Open principles in many different ways. However, it appeared that most of them were not connected to each other. In short, there wasn't a "community".

**So what to do about it?**

### A model for Galway? Open Science Communities in the Netherlands
The Netherlands are in many ways leading on Open Scholarship (or Open Science as they call it) in Europe. They have a growing network of Open Science Communities (OSCs) with the [Open Science Community Utrecht](https://openscience-utrecht.com/) the first (?) and very active. OSC Utrecht have even written a [step-by-step tutorial](https://openscience-utrecht.com/community-blueprint/) on how to start your own OSC!

### The Galway flavour
So looking at the Utrecht OSC model, can we pull off something similar in Galway? I think yes, that seems like a great way to connect Open enthusiasts, share our knowledge and experience and get others on board!

One of the principles we agreed early on is that this is a **Community for all of Galway**, not just NUI Galway. We are reaching out to other institutions like [GMIT](https://www.gmit.ie/) and the [Marine Institute](https://www.marine.ie/Home/home) and are hopeful that we can build a welcoming Community.

More details will emerge after our first meeting on [25 November 2019](https://open-scholarship-community-galway.github.io/event/2019/11/25/OSCG-Early-Adopters-meeting/). This is an exciting initiative with hopefully lots more to come!
