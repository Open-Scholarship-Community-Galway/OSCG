# What's happening in 2020?
*NUI Galway's Open Scholarship Librarian Hardy Schwamm looking forward to OSCG's activities in 2020.*

### What is the OSCG about?
Before we think about what our Community should do in 2020 we need to reflect on our principles and values:

- We are a grassroots, researcher-led community that wants to promote Open practices in Galway
- We are inclusive of disciplines and perspectives
- We want to collaborate with like-minded initiatives and people

### What are our priorities? 
Ahead of our last meeting I conducted a small survey among OSCG members. Here are the priorities with the top priority first:

- Engaging with the public (Citizen Science)
- Open Research Infrastructure
- Open Educational Resources
- Open Publishing
- FAIR Data
- Rewarding & Incentivising Open Practices
- Responsible Use of Metrics

### So what next?
Until summer we have a number of activities planned that will address some of our priorities above:

- 23 March - Open Scholarship talk at [GMIT](https://www.gmit.ie/)

- 26 March - [Open Scholar Caf√©: Engaging with the Public](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/open-scholarship-cafe-engaging-with-the-public-tickets-93494006089) at NUIG

- 20 April - Open Textbooks (registration will open soon). Co-hosted with [NUIG Student Union](https://su.nuigalway.ie/) and the [College of Engineering & Informatics](http://www.nuigalway.ie/engineering-informatics/).

- 11-15 May [Open Scholarship Week 2020](http://www.nuigalway.ie/osw/) at NUIG in partnership with [James Hardiman Library](https://library.nuigalway.ie/). Our flagship event that will "launch" OSCG to the wider world. One week of talks and workshops organised by OSCG. Registration for events will open in mid-March.
